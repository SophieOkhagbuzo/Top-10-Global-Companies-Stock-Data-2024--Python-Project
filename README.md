# Top-10-Global-Companies-Stock-Data-2024--Python-Project
In this project, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on top 10 global companies' stock data to uncover trends, relationships, and volatility patterns
Key insights include:

Price Trends: By analyzing the closing prices over time, we identified upward trends with occasional dips, reflecting the stockâ€™s overall growth trajectory during the time period.

Volatility: Using the high and low prices, it was observed that the stock experienced notable intraday fluctuations, indicating periods of higher volatility. Additionally, the difference between the adjusted close and close prices indicated the presence of dividends and stock splits.

Volume Analysis: The volume of shares traded varied significantly, with higher trading volumes correlating with significant price movements, indicating strong investor activity during key events.

Correlation: A correlation heatmap between open, high, low, close, and volume revealed that the stock prices (open, high, low, close) are highly correlated, as expected. Interestingly, the volume had a weaker correlation with these price variables, suggesting that price movements weren't always tied directly to trading volume.
The analysis of stock data for the top global companies yielded several key insights. The closing price trends were central in identifying overall stock performance, while the adjusted close price offered an adjusted view accounting for corporate actions. Volume analysis indicated periods of high trading activity, which often coincided with notable price movements.The use of a correlation heatmap between variables like open, close, high, and volume revealed strong relationships between price-related variables, while volume showed a more complex relationship with stock prices. The project provided actionable insights into market trends and helped identify patterns in investor behavior across different companies.

This analysis forms the foundation for more advanced forecasting techniques, such as time-series analysis or predictive modeling, to anticipate future stock movements.

General Conclusion: The analysis confirms that the companies follows general market trends, with significant price growth over time. Short-term fluctuations and trading volumes provide deeper insight into investor behavior during specific periods.
